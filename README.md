# Javascript Quiz

## Description

This project is a JavaScript Quiz that challenges users on their knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals. The quiz is timed, and users need to answer a series of multiple-choice questions. After completing the quiz, users can save their initials and score to compare their performance with others.

The motivation behind this project is to create an interactive and engaging way for users to test their knowledge of JavaScript. It provides an opportunity for self-assessment and allows users to track their progress over time.

### Problem Solving

This quiz app solves the problem of assessing a user's understanding of JavaScript concepts in a timed and challenging environment. It also offers a feature to save and display high scores, fostering friendly competition among users.

### Learning

While working on this project, I gained practical experience in building a responsive and interactive web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned how to manipulate the DOM, handle user input, and manage timers.
